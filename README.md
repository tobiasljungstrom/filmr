# Filmr: Cinema Management System

##Installation
This project is based on Spring Boot, and uses Maven for dependencies and deployment. It also uses a mySql database for persistance.

Download the repository and open the folder in your favourite IDE (we use IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse).

In the folder src/main/resources add the file application.yml and paste the following code (substitute database values for you own):

*Sorry for the hassle. We're looking into creating a more user friendly and less hacky way to install the software.*

## Functionality (as of v0.3)
### The admin interface
##### The main page
##### The cinema page
##### The theater page
### The customer interface
##### The booking pages


## Version History
### 0.1 Demo
A simple demo version intended to display the most basic functionality of a finished system.
### 0.2 Admin
A more fleshed out version of the admin tools. Among other things, functionalty for adding and removing cinemas, theaters and showings were added in this version.
### 0.3 Project end
This release marks the end of the limited project, during which this product was created. This version adds capability for a "customer" to book tickets and experience all the changes and configurations made in the admin interface. Also a major facelift and improvement to the user experience.

*This is the current state of the software, but with the right incentive we might develop it further. :)*
